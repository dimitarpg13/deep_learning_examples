### Conv2d class implementation in torch

```python
class Conv2d(_ConvNd):
    __doc__ = r"""Applies a 2D convolution over an input signal composed of several input
    planes.

    In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size
    :math:`(N, C_{\text{in}}, H, W)` and output :math:`(N, C_{\text{out}}, H_{\text{out}}, W_{\text{out}})`
    can be precisely described as:

    .. math::
        \text{out}(N_i, C_{\text{out}_j}) = \text{bias}(C_{\text{out}_j}) +
        \sum_{k = 0}^{C_{\text{in}} - 1} \text{weight}(C_{\text{out}_j}, k) \star \text{input}(N_i, k)


    where :math:`\star` is the valid 2D `cross-correlation`_ operator,
    :math:`N` is a batch size, :math:`C` denotes a number of channels,
    :math:`H` is a height of input planes in pixels, and :math:`W` is
    width in pixels.
    """ + r"""

    This module supports :ref:`TensorFloat32<tf32_on_ampere>`.

    On certain ROCm devices, when using float16 inputs this module will use :ref:`different precision<fp16_on_mi200>` for backward.

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation, a single
      number or a tuple.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of padding applied to the input. It
      can be either a string {{'valid', 'same'}} or an int / a tuple of ints giving the
      amount of implicit padding applied on both sides.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also
      known as the Ã  trous algorithm. It is harder to describe, but this `link`_
      has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    {groups_note}

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`dilation` can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the height and width dimension
        - a ``tuple`` of two ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the height dimension,
          and the second `int` for the width dimension

    Note:
        ``padding='valid'`` is the same as no padding. ``padding='same'`` pads
        the input so the output has the shape as the input. However, this mode
        doesn't support any stride values other than 1.

## <a id="max-pool"></a>MaxPool layer

### Basics on Max Pooling

Max pooling is a downsampling technique commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to reduce the spatial dimensions of an input volume. It is a form of non-linear down-sampling that serves to make the representation smaller and more manageable, and to reduce the number of parameters and computation in the network. Max pooling operates independently on each depth slice of the input and resizes it spatially.

The primary objective of max pooling is to reduce the amount of information in an image while maintaining the essential features necessary for accurate image recognition. This process helps to make the detection of features in input data invariant to scale and orientation changes and also aids in preventing overfitting.

How Max Pooling works?

Max pooling is performed on the convolutional layers of a CNN. It involves sliding a window (often called a filter or kernel) across the input data, similar to the convolution step, but instead of performing a matrix multiplication, max pooling takes the maximum value within the window. This maximum value becomes a single pixel in the new, pooled output. The window is then slid across the input data by a stride of a certain number of pixels, and the process is repeated until the entire input image has been processed.

Typically, the size of the pooling window is 2x2, and the stride with which the window is moved is also 2 pixels. This setup reduces the size of the input by half, both in height and width, effectively reducing the total number of pixels by 75%.

Max Pooling vs other Pooling methods

While max pooling is a popular choice, there are other pooling methods, such as average pooling and L2-norm pooling. Average pooling takes the average of all values in the pooling window, which can result in smoother pooled outputs. L2-norm pooling takes the square root of the sum of squares of the values in the window. Each pooling method has its own advantages and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the model or the type of data being processed.

In practice, max pooling layers are placed after convolutional layers in a CNN. After a convolutional layer extracts features from the input image, the max pooling layer reduces the spatial size of the convolved feature map, keeping only the most salient information. This process is repeated for multiple convolutional and pooling layers, allowing the network to learn a hierarchy of features at various levels of abstraction.

Max pooling is a simple yet effective technique that has been instrumental in the success of CNNs in various applications, particularly in image and video recognition tasks. Its ability to reduce the computational burden while maintaining the essential features has made it a staple component in deep learning architectures.

Challenges with Max Pooling

Despite its benefits, max pooling is not without its challenges. One criticism is that it can sometimes be too aggressive, discarding potentially useful information that could be important for the classification task. Moreover, max pooling is a fixed operation and does not learn from the data, unlike convolutional layers that have learnable parameters.

As a result, some modern CNN architectures have started to move away from traditional max pooling layers, using alternatives like strided convolutions for downsampling or incorporating learnable pooling operations that can adapt to the data.

### Max Pooling layer implementation in torch


```python
class MaxPool2d(_MaxPoolNd):
    r"""Applies a 2D max pooling over an input signal composed of several input planes.

    In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size :math:`(N, C, H, W)`,
    output :math:`(N, C, H_{out}, W_{out})` and :attr:`kernel_size` :math:`(kH, kW)`
    can be precisely described as:

    .. math::
        \begin{aligned}
            out(N_i, C_j, h, w) ={} & \max_{m=0, \ldots, kH-1} \max_{n=0, \ldots, kW-1} \\
                                    & \text{input}(N_i, C_j, \text{stride[0]} \times h + m,
                                                   \text{stride[1]} \times w + n)
        \end{aligned}

    If :attr:`padding` is non-zero, then the input is implicitly padded with negative infinity on both sides
    for :attr:`padding` number of points. :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points.
    It is harder to describe, but this `link`_ has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    Note:
        When ceil_mode=True, sliding windows are allowed to go off-bounds if they start within the left padding
        or the input. Sliding windows that would start in the right padded region are ignored.

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`dilation` can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the height and width dimension
        - a ``tuple`` of two ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the height dimension,
          and the second `int` for the width dimension

        kernel_size: the size of the window to take a max over
        stride: the stride of the window. Default value is :attr:`kernel_size`
        padding: Implicit negative infinity padding to be added on both sides
        dilation: a parameter that controls the stride of elements in the window
        return_indices: if ``True``, will return the max indices along with the outputs.
                        Useful for :class:`torch.nn.MaxUnpool2d` later
        ceil_mode: when True, will use `ceil` instead of `floor` to compute the output shape

        - Input: :math:`(N, C, H_{in}, W_{in})` or :math:`(C, H_{in}, W_{in})`
        - Output: :math:`(N, C, H_{out}, W_{out})` or :math:`(C, H_{out}, W_{out})`, where

### The CrossEntropyClass

```python
class CrossEntropyLoss(_WeightedLoss):
    r"""This criterion computes the cross entropy loss between input logits
    and target.

    It is useful when training a classification problem with `C` classes.
    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D `Tensor`
    assigning weight to each of the classes.
    This is particularly useful when you have an unbalanced training set.

    The `input` is expected to contain the unnormalized logits for each class (which do `not` need
    to be positive or sum to 1, in general).
    `input` has to be a Tensor of size :math:`(C)` for unbatched input,
    :math:`(minibatch, C)` or :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` for the
    `K`-dimensional case. The last being useful for higher dimension inputs, such
    as computing cross entropy loss per-pixel for 2D images.

    The `target` that this criterion expects should contain either:

    - Class indices in the range :math:`[0, C)` where :math:`C` is the number of classes; if
      `ignore_index` is specified, this loss also accepts this class index (this index
      may not necessarily be in the class range). The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction`
      set to ``'none'``) loss for this case can be described as:

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
          l_n = - w_{y_n} \log \frac{\exp(x_{n,y_n})}{\sum_{c=1}^C \exp(x_{n,c})}
          \cdot \mathbb{1}\{y_n \not= \text{ignore\_index}\}

      where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight,
      :math:`C` is the number of classes, and :math:`N` spans the minibatch dimension as well as
      :math:`d_1, ..., d_k` for the `K`-dimensional case. If
      :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'`` (default ``'mean'``), then

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
              \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^N w_{y_n} \cdot \mathbb{1}\{y_n \not= \text{ignore\_index}\}} l_n, &
               \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
                \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
                \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
            \end{cases}

      Note that this case is equivalent to applying :class:`~torch.nn.LogSoftmax`
      on an input, followed by :class:`~torch.nn.NLLLoss`.

    - Probabilities for each class; useful when labels beyond a single class per minibatch item
      are required, such as for blended labels, label smoothing, etc. The unreduced (i.e. with
      :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss for this case can be described as:

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
          l_n = - \sum_{c=1}^C w_c \log \frac{\exp(x_{n,c})}{\sum_{i=1}^C \exp(x_{n,i})} y_{n,c}

      where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight,
      :math:`C` is the number of classes, and :math:`N` spans the minibatch dimension as well as
      :math:`d_1, ..., d_k` for the `K`-dimensional case. If
      :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'`` (default ``'mean'``), then

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
              \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N l_n}{N}, &
               \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
                \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
                \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
            \end{cases}

    .. note::
        The performance of this criterion is generally better when `target` contains class
        indices, as this allows for optimized computation. Consider providing `target` as
        class probabilities only when a single class label per minibatch item is too restrictive.

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each class.
            If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C` and floating point dtype
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When :attr:`size_average` is
            ``True``, the loss is averaged over non-ignored targets. Note that
            :attr:`ignore_index` is only applicable when the target contains class indices.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
        label_smoothing (float, optional): A float in [0.0, 1.0]. Specifies the amount
            of smoothing when computing the loss, where 0.0 means no smoothing. The targets
            become a mixture of the original ground truth and a uniform distribution as described in
            `Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567>`__. Default: :math:`0.0`.

    Shape:
        - Input: Shape :math:`(C)`, :math:`(N, C)` or :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: If containing class indices, shape :math:`()`, :math:`(N)` or :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with
          :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of K-dimensional loss where each value should be between :math:`[0, C)`.
          If containing class probabilities, same shape as the input and each value should be between :math:`[0, 1]`.
        - Output: If reduction is 'none', shape :math:`()`, :math:`(N)` or :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of K-dimensional loss, depending on the shape of the input. Otherwise, scalar.
